# Accident-detection
Overview
The Accident Detection & Alert System is an intelligent, real-time solution designed to minimize the number of fatal outcomes in road accidents by ensuring timely emergency alerts. It integrates sensor data, GPS location tracking, and machine learning-based image analysis to detect accidents, determine their severity, and notify emergency services and the victim's family—improving response time and potentially saving lives.

🌟 Key Features
🔍 Dual-Layer Detection: Combines sensor readings and ML-based image analysis to detect accidents accurately.

🛰️ GPS Enabled: Tracks and shares the exact accident location for quick medical assistance.

📞 GSM-Based Alerting: Sends alerts and messages to emergency services and predefined contacts.

🎥 Camera & Audio Monitoring: Assesses the condition of the driver post-accident through image and voice data.

⚙️ Cost-Efficient & Scalable: Designed to be affordable, reliable, and adaptable for real-world deployment.

🧠 Machine Learning Integration
Image Analysis
YOLO (You Only Look Once): Used for real-time object detection to identify vehicle crashes, pedestrians, and other road features.

SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference): Works in tandem with YOLO by slicing images into segments to improve detection accuracy and precision.

Sensor Data Fusion
Accelerometer & Gyroscope: Monitor movement patterns to detect sudden changes characteristic of collisions.

ML Cross-Verification: Sensor-based predictions are verified using image analysis, reducing false positives.

🔧 Core Components
Component	Role
YOLO + SAHI	Real-time image-based accident detection with high precision
Accelerometer & Gyroscope	Physical crash detection based on sudden changes in motion
GPS Module	Pinpoints the exact accident location
GSM Module	Sends SMS/alerts to emergency responders and family members
Camera	Captures post-accident condition of the driver
Voice Assistant	Assesses driver responsiveness to gauge injury severity

💡 Unique Functionalities
Driver Response Assessment: After detecting a crash, a voice assistant checks for the driver’s responsiveness to help assess severity.

Scene Awareness for Responders: YOLO + SAHI together detect surrounding hazards, enabling emergency services to arrive fully prepared.

Robust Validation System: The hybrid model reduces false alarms by validating results through multiple sources—sensors and ML models.
